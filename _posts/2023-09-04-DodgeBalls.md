A couple of years ago, I wanted to start diving into game programming.
One of the first programming languages that came to mind was JavaScript.
I chose it mainly because I wanted to refine my coding skills, but also because I prefer that the projects I work on can be tested via a 
web browser (trend that continues to this day). I knew that the JavaScript + HTML5 duo was the simplest choice to achieve this.

Most tutorials I looked at (YouTube, Google) made use of some kind of external library, which I wanted to avoid at all costs.
I have a preference from coding "everything from scratch", even if it is rough around the edges.
Luckily, I came across this great tutorial [HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI9idPTT0c4).
The tutorial does use one external library, `tailwindcss`, but I managed to avoid it by using plain css.
