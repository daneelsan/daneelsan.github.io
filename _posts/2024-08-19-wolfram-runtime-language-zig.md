The [Wolfram Language Runtime SDK](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/07/yet-more-new-ideas-and-new-functions-launching-version-14-1-of-wolfram-language-mathematica/#standalone-wolfram-language-applications) (new in version 14.1) caught my attention recently, particularly because I'm interested in integrating the Wolfram Language with other programming environments. Instead of using C to experiment with these standalone applications, I opted for the Zig programming language. Zig’s modern features like transparent control flow and explicit memory management align well with my development practices.

To make this work, I manually wrote a "wlr.zig" file that replicates what’s done with the "WolframLanguageRuntimeSDK.h" C header file. Although Zig is still evolving and has a steeper learning curve—mainly due to the limited documentation, it enables safer and more predictable code execution. The end result is an executable that performs just as well as the C version, with the added advantages that come from using Zig.
